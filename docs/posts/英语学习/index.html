To start with , just as XXX has said , ... In addition , ... 科技 产品 消费 效率 心理需求 心理满足 As far as I am concerned buying the newest technological devices would be a wise choice . My view is going to be illustrated by the following reasons and examples.\nTo start with , the newest technological devices help users to improve their efficiency , no matter in work or study . It should be emphasized that along with the accelerating development of the whole society , a higher efficiency becomes more and more important . It allows individuals to accomplish more tasks within relatively certain time limits , which in turn strengthens one’s competitiveness and offers them a higher chance to succeed. In that case , buying new technological devices serves better in assisting the person to get high efficiency . To be specific , there is no doubt that new technological devices generally have advantages compared with existing ones . For example, they may offer some new functions or improve existing ones , and all these factors play an essential role in helping people achieve their aims more effectively , removing the barriers as well as difficulties. As a result , people who use new technological devices are capable of finishing tasks more quickly . In other words , new technological devices guarantee high efficiency.\nIn addition , using the newest technological devices also brings individuals the benefit of realizing their higher needs. Thanks to the development of the economy and technology, people in current society have almost fulfilled their basic needs related to survival and safety . Under such circumstances , they have begun to realize those need that are at a higher level . Those needs are usually more psychological and social , which makes the choice of buying the newest technological devices reasonable . To give more details , people using the newest technological devices are able to enjoy the feeling of happiness and satisfaction after they buy it immediately since this behavior continuously implies to them that they have the right and the ability to enjoy the best things. Besides , people who possess the newest devices usually can grab the attention of people surrounding them , which enables them to enclose relationship with others and even harvest other people’s respect or envy . All factors listed above , psychological feelings and connections with others , are just what nowadays people mainly are pursuing , and it supports my standpoint that buying the newest devices , rather than adopting them when they are well-adopted , is worth the effort .\nAs far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that people should like to pursue the devices of the newest version. My view is going to illustrated by following reasons and example.\nTo start with, just as Mike has said, the newest technological devices help users to improve their efficiency, no matter in work or study. It should be emphasized that along with the accelerating development of the whole society , a higher efficiency becomes more and more important. It allows individuals to accomplish more tasks within relatively certain time limits , which in turn strengthens one’s competitiveness and offers them a higher chance to succeed.\nIn addition , using the newest technological devices also brings individuals the benefit of realizing their higher needs. To be more specific , people using the newest technological devices are able to enjoy the feeling of happiness and satisfaction after they buy it immediately .\nsince this behavior continuously implies to them that they have the right and the ability to enjoy the best things.\n创造力 As far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that the power of creativity far outweighs that basic knowledge in terms of successful inventions. My view is going to illustrated by following reasons and example. To start with , just as Mike has said , the power of creativity far exceeds the power of basic knowledge. For instance , Bell is commonly credited with inventing the first practical telephone by taking advantage of his creativity and numerous endeavors. It is precisely due to his creativity that such scientific breakthroughs have been made. In addition , in the modern world , similar evidence could be also be traced . Steve Jobs , co-founders and former CEO of Apple , shocked the world with his creative electronic products whose superior functions and qualities can never be matched. 压力 健康 生活压力\nAs far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that government should arouse people’s awareness of importance of physical soundness. My view is going to be illustrated by following reasons and example. To start with , just as Mike has said , with the acceleration of social development , people , especially young people , are confronted with unprecedentedly fierce competition . For instance , they need to work very hard to guarantee a decent life , which causes them much(way) heavier pressure than before. Under such circumstances , most of them are prone to in a sub-health state . In summary , government should increase access to public exercise equipment in neighborhood , raising people’s awareness of the importance of doing exercise regularly through the mass media , which is the government’s responsibility. 因特网 科技 社会发展 生活方式\nAs far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that Internet is a treasure trove of information , which offers knowledge on any given topic under the sun. My view is going to be illustrated by following reasons and examples. To start with , just as Mike has said , search engines make information accessible on various subject matters such as government law and services , trade and conferences , market information , new innovations , and technical support , and even dispense advise on love and relationship matters. In addition , it has become common practice to seek assistance from the web in order to research and gather resources for homework , office presentations , and supplement one’s own research . The web also updates news about the latest breakthroughs in the field of medicine , technology , and other domains of science . 兴趣 爱好\nAs far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that young students should not decrease an abundance of time that teaching students about music and art . My view is going to be illustrated by following reasons and examples .\nTo start with , just as Mike has said , we should emphasize what is conveyed in the famous saying: ‘Interest is the best teacher.’ Evidently , the primary step toward a person’s success is to have an emotional preference . In fact , interest constitutes the biggest impetus in learning , keeping one refreshed and preventing feelings of boredom and tiredness .\nIn addition , numerous epoch-making accomplishments in the scientific world owe much to the initial interest of the scientists. Therefore , students shouldn’t be compelled to increase the time spent on any knowledge field , but rather to keep a balance among all knowledge fields.\n学生是否要 gap — 兴趣 As far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that students should take at least a year off to work or travel before they begin studying at a university when students finish their high school , which can be beneficial for students to discover their interests. My view is going to be illustrated by the following reasons and examples.\nTo start with , just as Mike has said , the famous saying goes , \" Interest is the best teacher.\" Evidently , the primary step toward a person’s success is to have an emotional preference. In fact , interest constitutes the biggest impetus in learning , keeping one refreshed and preventing feelings of boredom and tiredness. Therefore , it is helpful that spending at least a year work or travel before getting the university education , which is one of the best ways to figure out personal passion if students want to be successful in their future careers.\n以 成绩 评分 As far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that performance should be the only criterion when teachers give grades. My view is going to be illustrated by following reasons and examples . To start with , just as Mike has said , such a strategy would show fairness , which is an important factor to motivate students. The lack of motivation would undoubtedly pose negative effects on student’s studies . Consequently , it would even have a lasting effect on their future life. In addition , giving grades based on performance , instead of effort , also means a clear standard . It would be hard for teachers to tell whether a student is working hard or not during the process. It is totally subjective . In contrast , the performance , in other words , the results , cannot tell lies , making the performance-based criteria a wiser one . Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is often not a good thing for people to move to a new town or country because they lose their old friends. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\n搬家 好不好 As far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that people wouldn’t lose their friends because they move to a new town or country. My view is going to be illustrated by following reasons and example. To start with , just as Mike has said , with the development of society , the infrastructure make it convenient as well as time-saving to travel another town or country, which means people can still meet up with friends easily . Going to a new town or country can also push individuals to broaden their perspectives and see the world in a distinctive way. In addition , the opportunities of being successful in future career are enhanced by settling in a big city . Simultaneously , I believe that the greatest predictor of being successful in the future career is how many hours are devoted to goal , rather than spending too much time with friends . 参考\nTo start with, as Mike mentioned, the development of society has made travel between towns and countries more convenient and time-saving. This means that people can still meet up with friends easily. Moving to a new place can also encourage individuals to broaden their perspectives and see the world in new ways.\nIn addition, settling in a big city can enhance opportunities for future career success. However, I believe that the greatest predictor of success is how many hours one devotes to their goals, rather than spending too much time with friends.\n帮助他人 with the development of …….. = due to the refinement of ……… = As advances in = through the improvement of ……… = due to the advancement of\nAs far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that currently, many people are accepted assistance from others people more readily than before . My view is going to be illustrated by following reason and example. To start with , just as Mike has said , due to the advancement of society , people are wealthier than before , individuals are more likely to spend more time to care about other , someone needs help , since the social responsibility would be powerful enough to push them to help other. In addition , take me for example , every time I see the homeless or someone needs help , I will lend them a hand , holding up social responsibility as much as possible. In this action , it is social harmony that is strongly promoted. ",

<p>As far as I am concerned buying the newest technological devices would be a wise choice . My view is going to be illustrated by the following reasons and examples.</p>
<p>To start with , the newest technological devices help users to improve their efficiency , no matter in work or study . It should be emphasized that along with the accelerating development of the whole society , a higher efficiency becomes more and more important . It allows individuals to accomplish more tasks within relatively certain time limits , which in turn strengthens one&rsquo;s competitiveness and offers them a higher chance to succeed. In that case , buying new technological devices serves better in assisting the person to get high efficiency . To be specific , there is no doubt that new technological devices generally have advantages compared with existing ones . For example, they may offer some new functions or improve existing ones , and all these factors play an essential role in helping people achieve their aims more effectively , removing the barriers as well as difficulties. As a result , people who use new technological devices are capable of finishing tasks more quickly . In other words , new technological devices guarantee high efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition , using the newest technological devices also brings individuals the benefit of realizing their higher needs. Thanks to the development of the economy and technology, people in current society have almost fulfilled their basic needs related to survival and safety . Under such circumstances , they have begun to realize those need that are at a higher level . Those needs are usually more psychological and social , which makes the choice of buying the newest technological devices reasonable .  To give more details , people using the newest technological devices are able to enjoy the feeling of happiness and satisfaction after they buy it immediately since this  behavior continuously implies to them that they have the right and the ability to enjoy the best things.  Besides , people who possess the newest devices usually can grab the attention of people surrounding them , which enables them to enclose relationship with others and even harvest other people&rsquo;s respect or envy . All factors listed above , psychological feelings and connections with others , are just what  nowadays people mainly are pursuing , and it supports my standpoint that buying the newest devices , rather than adopting them when they are well-adopted , is worth the effort .</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>As far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that</em> people should like to <strong>pursue</strong> the devices of the newest version. <em>My view is going to illustrated by following reasons and example.</em></p>

<li><em>As far as I am concerned , I tend to be <strong>in</strong> favor of the argument that</em> the power of creativity far outweighs that basic knowledge in terms of successful inventions. <em>My view is going to illustrated by following reasons and example.</em></li>
<li>T<em>o start with , just as Mike has said</em> , the power of creativity far exceeds the power of basic knowledge. For instance , Bell is commonly credited with inventing the first practical telephone by taking advantage of his creativity and numerous endeavors. It is precisely due to his creativity that such scientific breakthroughs have been made.</li>
<li><em>In addition</em> , in the modern world , similar evidence could be also be traced . Steve Jobs , co-founders and former CEO of Apple , shocked the world with his creative electronic products whose superior functions and qualities can never be matched.</li>

<li>To start with , just as Mike has said , with the acceleration of social development , people , especially young people , are confronted with unprecedentedly fierce competition . For instance , they need to work very hard to guarantee a decent life , which causes them much(way)  heavier pressure than before. Under such circumstances , most of them are prone to  in a  sub-health state .</li>
<li>In summary , government should increase access to public exercise equipment in neighborhood , raising people&rsquo;s awareness of the importance of doing exercise regularly through the mass media , which is the government&rsquo;s responsibility.</li>

<li>As far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that Internet is a treasure trove of information , which offers knowledge on any given topic under the sun. My view is going to  be illustrated by following reasons and examples.</li>
<li>To start with , just as Mike has said , search engines make information accessible on various subject matters such as government law and services , trade and conferences , market information , new innovations , and technical support , and even dispense advise on love and  relationship matters.</li>
<li>In addition ,  it has become common practice to seek assistance from the web in order to research and gather resources for homework , office presentations , and supplement one&rsquo;s own research . The web also updates news about the latest breakthroughs in the field of medicine , technology , and other domains of science .</li>

<p>As far as I am concerned , I tend  to be in favor of the argument that young students should not decrease an abundance of time that teaching students about music and art . My view is going to  be illustrated by following reasons and examples .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To start with , just as Mike has said ,  we should emphasize what is conveyed in the famous saying: &lsquo;Interest is the best teacher.&rsquo; Evidently , the primary step toward a person&rsquo;s success is to have an emotional preference . In fact , interest constitutes the biggest impetus in learning , keeping one refreshed and preventing feelings of boredom and tiredness .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition , numerous epoch-making accomplishments in the scientific world owe much to the initial interest of the scientists. Therefore , students shouldn&rsquo;t  be compelled to increase the time spent on any knowledge field , but rather to keep a balance among all knowledge fields.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that students should take at least a year off to work or travel before they begin studying at a university when students finish their high school , which can be beneficial for students to discover their interests. My view is going to be illustrated by the following reasons and examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To start with , just as Mike has said , the famous saying goes , &quot; Interest is the best teacher.&quot;  Evidently , the primary step toward a person&rsquo;s success is to have an emotional preference. In fact , interest constitutes the biggest impetus in learning , keeping one refreshed and preventing feelings of boredom and tiredness. Therefore , it is helpful that spending at least a year work or travel before getting the university education , which is one of the best ways to figure out  personal passion if students want to be successful in their future careers.</p>

<ul>
<li>As far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that performance should be the only criterion when teachers give grades. My view is going to be illustrated by following reasons and examples .</li>
<li>To start with , just as Mike has said , such a strategy would show fairness , which is an important factor to motivate students. The lack of motivation would undoubtedly pose negative effects on student&rsquo;s studies . Consequently , it would even have a lasting effect on their future life.</li>
<li>In addition , giving grades based on performance , instead of effort , also means a clear standard . It would be hard for teachers to tell whether a student is working hard or not during the process. It is totally subjective . In contrast , the performance , in other words , the results , cannot tell lies , making the performance-based criteria a wiser one .</li>

<p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? <strong>It is often not a good thing for people to move to a new town or country because they lose their old friends.</strong> Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</p>

<li>As far as I am concerned , I tend to be in favor of the argument that people wouldn&rsquo;t lose their friends because they move to a new town or country. My view is going to be illustrated by following reasons and example.</li>
<li>To start with , just as Mike has said ,  with the development of society , the infrastructure make it convenient as well as time-saving to travel another town or country, which means people can still meet up with friends easily . Going to a new town or country can also push individuals to broaden their perspectives and see the world in a distinctive way.</li>
<li>In addition , the opportunities of being successful in future career are enhanced by settling in a big city  . Simultaneously , I believe that the greatest predictor of being successful in the future career is how many hours are devoted to goal , rather than spending too much time with friends .</li>
